abstract = {The Data Science domain has expanded monumentally in both research and industry communities during the past decade, predominantly owing to the Big Data revolution. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are bringing more complexities to data engineering applications, which are now integrated into data processing pipelines to process terabytes of data. Typically, a significant amount of time is spent on data preprocessing in these pipelines, and hence improving its efficiency directly impacts the overall pipeline performance. The community has recently embraced the concept of Dataframes as the de-facto data structure for data representation and manipulation. However, the most widely used serial Dataframes today (R, pandas) experience performance limitations while working on even moderately large data sets. We believe that there is plenty of room for improvement by taking a look at this problem from a high-performance computing point of view. In a prior publication, we presented a set of parallel processing patterns for distributed dataframe operators and the reference runtime implementation, CylonÂ [1]. In this paper, we are expanding on the initial concept by introducing a cost model for evaluating the said patterns. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of Cylon on the ORNL Summit supercomputer.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The control efficacy of classical periodic forcing and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is assessed for a turbulent separation bubble (TSB) at ReÏ  = 180 on the upstream region before separation occurs. The TSB can resemble a separation phenomenon naturally arising in wings, and a successful reduction of the TSB can have practical implications in the reduction of the aviation carbon footprint. We find that the classical zero-net-mas-flux (ZNMF) periodic control is able to reduce the TSB by 15.7%. On the other hand, the DRL-based control achieves 25.3% reduction and provides a smoother control strategy while also being ZNMF. To the best of our knowledge, the current test case is the highest Reynolds-number flow that has been successfully controlled using DRL to this date. In future work, these results will be scaled to well-resolved large-eddy simulation grids. Furthermore, we provide details of our open-source CFDâDRL framework suited for the next generation of exascale computing machines.}

abstract={Combining machine learning (ML) with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) opens many possibilities for improving simulations of technical and natural systems. However, CFD+ML algorithms require exchange of data, synchronization, and calculation on heterogeneous hardware, making their implementation for large-scale problems exceptionally challenging. We provide an effective and scalable solution to developing CFD+ML algorithms using open source software OpenFOAM and SmartSim. SmartSim provides an Orchestrator that significantly simplifies the programming of CFD+ML algorithms enables scalable data exchange between ML and CFD clients. We show how to leverage SmartSim to effectively couple different segments of OpenFOAM with ML, including pre/post-processing applications, function objects, and mesh motion solvers. We additionally provide an OpenFOAM sub-module with examples that can be used as starting points for real-world applications in CFD+ML.},
